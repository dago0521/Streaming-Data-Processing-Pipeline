Letâ€™s assume you work for a company that offers a paid website service with about 10 Million daily accounts. There has been some reports of multiple people in different countries sharing the same account id and password (this is a naive use case, a website with a good authentication system can usually detect this) and because of this fraudulent behavior the company you work for is loosing a lot of money. The company wants to detect these fraudulent accounts in real time as they are happening. The company also wants to analyze the different actions performed by the users of these accounts such as click, purchase, login, log-out, delete-account, create-account, update-settings and other actions in real time.
